# Team Profile Generator

## Description:



This application is used to generate a HTML file that displays new team member information using the command line. When the user inputs *node index.js* into the command line, a series of questions will be populated. The questions will give the user the ability to input information about a Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Only one Manager's information can be entered into the command line, but for Engineer's and Intern's, the user can input as many as needed. Once all of the questions are answered about the team members, a HTML file will be generated with all of the information. Once the HTML file is opened into the browser, all of the information will be displayed in a visually pleasing manor.
